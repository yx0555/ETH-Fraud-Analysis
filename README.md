# ETH-Fraud-Analysis
A fraud detection project using ML and deep learning tools such as PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras etc. Analysis is done on an online Ethereum dataset found on Kaggle.
Designed for NUS Fraud Analytics Group project

Compliance with regulatory policies is a significant challenge when combating cryptocurrencies fraud.
For example, Know-Your-Customer (KYC) is a regulatory policy where it is mandatory to collect
customers' personal information before they are allowed to transact. This acts as a deterrent for
fraudsters. However, KYC goes against the principle of decentralisation, which is what crypto was
originally made to achieve (having a centralised authority store a user's personal data). KYC policies
can lead to lengthy onboarding times and thus poor customer experience. Furthermore, it is
challenging to keep track and ensure that customer data remains accurate and up-to-date, since it is
hard to enforce that customers update their personal details. These reasons deterred exchanges from
adopting these policies2.
Our project attempts to overcome these challenges by using machine learning technology to combat
cryptocurrencies fraud. Machine learning can uncover patterns that may not be noticed by humans.
Machine learning can help fill in the information gaps created by cryptocurrency's pseudo-anonymity
as certain models can extract information from a blockchain ledger and review the transaction
histories between public addressed. The machine learning models we used train the dataset based on
the fraudulent activities and its features and predict future unseen crypto activities, determining
whether they are fraudulent or not.
